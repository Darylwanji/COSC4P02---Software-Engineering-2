Much of the orientation to and instruction in professional practice takes place through supervised cohorts of teacher candidates in schools throughout the Niagara Peninsula and the regions of Hamilton Wentworth, Haldimand-Brant, Halton and Peel. Transportation to required off-campus courses, professional development events and schools is the responsibility of the teacher candidate.

When performance in the practicum placement is regarded as inadequate, the teacher candidate will be assessed by the Practice Teaching Co-ordinator or designate. That assessment will determine eligibility to proceed. Where performance so warrants, and in the interest of the pupils' welfare, the Teacher Education program will not place a teacher candidate in a classroom or will remove a teacher candidate from the classroom.",
