b'At Brock University, Applied Linguistics involves the application of linguistic theories and methods of linguistic analysis in such areas as first or subsequent language acquisition, psycholinguistics, language teaching methodology, and speech, language and hearing sciences.'
b'Linguistics focuses on language structure, first- and subsequent-language acquisition, the role of language in communication, and languages as products of cultures and other social groups. Linguists may or may not specialize in particular languages. Typically, they analyze similarities and differences among languages; such analyses can be used to develop, support or refute linguistic theories.'
b'Linguistics provides an opportunity to apply scientific reasoning to language-based problem solving. A background in linguistics is essential for language teachers, translators, speech-language pathologists, audiologists and many other language professionals. Additionally, linguistic knowledge can provide a valuable foundation for human interaction and communication in a wide variety of fields.'
b'The Department of Applied Linguistics offers programs of study leading to Honours Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees in Applied Linguistics/Teaching English as a Second Language, Speech Language and Hearing Sciences. Students completing the Honours Speech Language and Hearing Sciences degree select a specialized concentration in either Hearing Sciences or Speech and Language Sciences after Year 1.'
b'The Department also offers a four-year program of study leading to a BA with Major in Speech Language and Hearing Sciences, Pass BA degrees in Applied Linguistics, and Speech Language and Hearing Sciences and Certificates in Speech Language and Hearing Sciences, and Teaching English as a Second Language as well as a Minor in Applied Linguistics.'

b'Biochemistry describes the structure, organization and function of living systems in molecular terms. The goals of biochemistry are to identify the chemical components and molecules (such as DNA, RNA and protein) of living cells and to determine the function of each component, how components interact, how they are integrated into biological systems, and how these components affect the overall functions of cells and living systems. The Biochemistry Program is a broadly based program designed to provide the student with a thorough understanding of living systems from a molecular perspective. The program is run jointly by the Departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry.'
b'The Biochemistry Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a five-year period. Students spend two years in an academic setting studying the fundamentals of Biochemistry prior to their first work placement. Successful completion of courses in the core areas of Biochemistry provides the necessary academic background for the work experience. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Biochemistry Co-op students are assessed an administrative fee for each work term (see the Schedule of Fees).'
b"Eligibility to continue in the Biochemistry Co-op program is based on the student's major and non-major averages. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average may continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Biochemistry Co-op program, but may continue in the non co-op Biochemistry stream. If a student subsequently raises his/her major average to 70 percent, the student may be re-admitted only if approved by the Co-op Admissions Committee. For further information, see the Co-op Programs section of the Calendar, and contact the Departments of Biological Sciences or Chemistry."
b"All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career."
b'Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.'
b'The Biochemistry Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.'

b'The biological sciences, or the life sciences, encompass a broad spectrum of subjects from molecular biology to ecology as well as such disciplines as biochemistry, biophysics, genetics and physiology. The program is designed to provide the student with a broad base in modern biological thought, to fulfill the basic requirements for admission to professional and advanced degree studies and to prepare graduates for careers in the biological sciences and related fields. Although the undergraduate program provides students with flexibility in selecting the areas of biology most compatible with their interests and skills, it also ensures that students develop an overview of the major concepts and problems of modern biology as expressed at all levels of biological organization.'
b'The objectives of the undergraduate program are realized through a group of core courses in years 1 and 2, each with an associated laboratory. Laboratory classes stress the investigative approach to experimental studies. Students move progressively from structured laboratory studies to increasingly independent investigations and in the honours year undertake individual research projects. Working from the core program, students may follow a variety of curriculum patterns to satisfy their interests.'
b'Students must consult faculty advisers when planning years 3 and 4 of the BSc (Honours) and BSc with Major programs or year 3 of the BSc (Pass) program.'
b'The honours year provides students with the opportunity for either broadening their understanding of the biological sciences or for increased specialization. Ideally, the honours program provides an opportunity for the synthesis of material presented in earlier years. Students must apply to the Department of Biological Sciences in order to be admitted to year 4 (honours).'
b'Prerequisite requirements are strictly enforced in Biological Sciences courses. Students lacking prerequisites will be automatically deregistered from courses. Students are encouraged to plan their courses two years ahead in order to ensure that appropriate prerequisites are obtained.'

b"Biophysics is the physics of life, of all living systems and their interaction with the surroundings, natural and artificial. It is a relatively new, but rapidly advancing field encompassing a wide variety of areas in natural and life sciences and uses all methods of scientific inquiry: theory, experiment and large scale computer simulation to understand living systems at the molecular level. Biophysics also forms the basis of many aspects of Medical Physics, another rapidly developing field in much demand at the current time. Brock's biophysics program will provide the students with a superb learning environment and exciting research opportunities. Extended research opportunities are available through Brock's participation in the Interdepartmental Biophysics Group (BIG) based at the University of Guelph."
b'The interdisciplinary nature of the Biophysics program offers an opportunity to modify the sequence of courses to be taken, to reflect better the interests of the individual students. However, this places a greater onus on the students to make sure that the prerequisites are satisfied, and that a sufficient number of credits at each level is included. Biophysics students are strongly encouraged to contact the Co-ordinator no later than year 2 of their studies, to ensure that their chosen sequence of courses satisfies all academic constraints.'
b'In view of the vastness of the field of Biophysics and the enormous diversity among its various subfields, the program offers a high degree of flexibility to its students at the 4th year level in terms of choice of BIOL, BTEC, CHEM, KINE, PHYS and PSYC/NEUR courses.'
b"Eligibility to continue in the program is based on the student's major average. All courses required for the program, excluding the electives, will be considered for the major average."
b"Biophysics is an Honours only program. If a student's major average falls below the required 70 percent average by year three, they are advised to seek a three-year BSc Degree in General Studies. Students should note that such a degree requires a minimum of five credits in one subject."

b'Biotechnology is the use of living organisms to produce goods and services for practical and industrial purposes. Biotechnology has been used for centuries in fermentation and the making of bread and cheese, but today involves new scientific tools like genetic and protein engineering, cell fusion and production of monoclonal antibodies. Biotechnology is a strategic technology and an important economic component of industrialized nations. Biotechnology at Brock is a joint effort of the Departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, with courses drawn from both departments plus courses designed specifically for the program.'
b'The Biotechnology Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a period of five academic years. Students spend two years in an academic setting studying the fundamentals of Biotechnology prior to their first work placement. Successful completion of courses in the core areas of Biotechnology provides the necessary academic background for the work experience. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Biotechnology Co-op students are assessed an administrative fee for each work term (see the Schedule of Fees).'
b"Eligibility to continue in the Biotechnology Co-op program is based on the student's major and non-major averages. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average may continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Biotechnology Co-op program, but may continue in the non-co-op Biotechnology stream. If a student subsequently raises his/her major average to 70 percent, the student may be readmitted only if approved by the Co-op Admissions Committee. For further information, see the Co-op Programs section of the Calendar, and contact the Centre for Biotechnology."
b"All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career."
b'Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.'
b'The Biotechnology Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.'

b'Chemistry is the study of matter and its interactions with various forms of energy. Brock students are involved in the analysis, synthesis and purification of substances, determining their structures and properties and explaining the mechanisms of processes.'
b'Our programs stress chemical principles and practice through research in organic, inorganic, analytical, physical and theoretical chemistry, with a strong emphasis on the interdisciplinary fields of bio-inorganic and bio-organic chemistry and chemical biophysics. Research interests of the department include development of new chiral ligands, organometallic reagents, and methods for asymmetric synthesis, green chemistry including bacterial dioxygenase-mediated degradation of aromatics, new approaches in natural product synthesis emphasizing morphine alkaloids, design and synthesis of fluorinated inhalation anesthetic agents and unnatural oligo-saccharide conjugates, ligand design and crystal engineering aimed at self-assembly of novel molecule-based materials, organic electrochemistry, energetics of photosynthesis studied by time-resolved electron spin resonance of short-lived paramagnetic intermediates, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, organometallic mass spectrometry, quantum and computational chemistry, pesticide and trace element analysis, protein affinity labelling and protein-lipid interactions, and structure-activity correlations of anticancer pharmaceuticals.'
b'The Honours program in Chemistry is designed to give the student a broad knowledge of chemistry as well as depth in areas in which the student is most interested. A research project must be successfully completed and a thesis written as part of the requirements for an Honours degree. The Honours program and certain combined Honours programs listed below, when taken with CHEM electives, satisfy the requirements for membership in the Chemical Institute of Canada and are the normal requirements for admission to graduate school in chemistry.'
b'The Chemistry Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a four and one half year period. Students spend two years in an academic setting, where they acquire the necessary background prior to taking the first work placement. Successful completion of courses in the core areas of Chemistry provides the necessary academic background for the work experience. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Chemistry Co-op students are assessed an annual administrative fee (see the Schedule of Fees).'
b"Eligibility to continue in the Co-op program is based on the student's major average and non-major average. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average will be permitted to continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Chemistry Co-op program, but may continue in the non Co-op Chemistry stream. For further information, see the Co-op Programs section of the Calendar, and contact the Department of Chemistry."
b"All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career."
b'Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.'
b'The requirement for graduation with a Chemistry (Honours) degree is a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average. The Chemistry Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.'
b"The equipment available in the Mackenzie Chown and Cairns Family Health and Bioscience Research Complexes is actively used for both teaching and research. Undergraduate students gain hands-on experience in operating modern equipment for separating of complex mixtures, determining molecular structures, and making quantitative measurements. Newer equipment is computer-controlled and is connected to the University's Ethernet backbone. Student and faculty researchers have access to cluster platform systems, housed at Brock Univeristy and other SHARCNet academic institutions."
b'Instrumentation includes 300, 400 and 600 MHz NMR cryospectrometers for high-resolution solution and solids studies. Mass spectrometry facilities include a Thermo DFS high resolution mass spectrometer with EI, CI and FAB ion sources. It is equipped with a high performance capillary GC system. The lab also contains a Bruker HCT Ultra LC/MS system with ESI and APCI interfaces and a BrukerAutoflex II TOF/TOF MALDI system. For X-ray crystallography, a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer, equipped with an Oxford low temperature device, is available for the collection of single crystal data. A number of spectroscopic instruments are available in the research laboratories including time-resolved EPR, ICP and ICP/MS, FTIR, UV/Visible, fluorescence cuvette and microplate fluorimeters. There are several chromatography systems for HPLC, FPLC and capillary GC analysis. A state-of-the-art biotechnology research lab was recently equipped for biochemistry and microbiology work. This instrumentation is augmented by a range of modern facilities available through the Cool Climate Oenology and Viticulture Institute, which support work in biochemistry, especially work involving proteins, nucleic acids, yeasts and bacteria.'
b'Students should consult the Department Chair when planning years 3 and 4 of the BSc (Honours) and BSc with Major programs, or year 3 of the BSc (Pass) program.'
b'In addition to its own programs, the Chemistry department participates in combined major programs with five other departments/centres and is also a major participant in the Biochemistry, Biotechnology, and Oenology and Viticulture programs.'

b'Economics is divided into two parts: Microeconomics and Macroeconomics. Microeconomics focuses on the operation of the market system under alternative scenarios about competition. It studies the economic decisions of individuals, households and firms and shows how those decisions interact to produce market outcomes. Microeconomics then examines the efficiency of the market outcomes and the extent to which they benefit society. Macroeconomics examines the functioning of the broader economy and some of its key sectors. Its main focus is on economic performance as measured by employment, unemployment, and the gap between aggregate economic activity and its potential. Through this analysis, macroeconomics identifies factors that help an economy achieve sustained increases in its standard of living. Macroeconomics also pays special attention to monetary phenomena, inflation, interest rates, and the exchange rate.'
b'The analytical tools developed in micro and macro economics are applied to many different subject areas within economics such as industrial organization, labour economics, international trade, economic development, taxation, and government expenditure. Other fields, such as money and banking and international payments, apply economic tools to the study of financial markets. The analyses yield insights and predictions that are used to develop public policy on a wide range of issues.'
b'The Economics (Honours) program provides a rigorous examination of economics. It prepares students for positions in all sectors of the economy and it is the recommended program for students considering graduate studies in economics. The Bachelor of Arts (BA) with Major Economics program also provides an in-depth study of economics, but it allows for more choice and breadth since it does not require some of the more technical senior level Economics courses. The pass Economics program covers the core topics in economics and allows students to complete a BA after completing only 15 credits.'

b'Housed within the Department of Educational Studies, the Teacher Education program offers three programs of study at the St. Catharines and Hamilton campuses for candidates interested in teaching Primary/Junior (grades K-6), Junior/Intermediate (grades 4-10) and Intermediate/Senior (grades 7-12). Field placements for the Junior/Intermediate program will normally be made in grades 4-8. Field placements for the Intermediate/Senior program will normally be made in grades 9-12.'
b'In addition, the Teacher Education program co-operates with other departments in offering concurrent programs leading to the conferring of a BA (Honours)/BEd (Intermediate/Senior), BA Child and Youth Studies (Honours)/BEd (Primary/Junior), BA Integrated Studies (Honours)/BEd (Junior/Intermediate), BPhEd (Honours)/BEd (Intermediate/Senior), BPhEd (Honours)/BEd (Junior/Intermediate), BSc (Honours)/BEd (Intermediate/Senior), BA Interactive Arts and Science (Honours)/BEd (Junior/Intermediate) and BSc Integrated Studies (Honours)/BEd (Junior/Intermediate).'
b'Teacher Education programs are field oriented and are based on an approach unique in Ontario. Much of the orientation to and instruction in professional practice takes place through supervised cohorts of teacher candidates in schools throughout the Niagara Peninsula and the regions of Hamilton Wentworth, Haldimand-Brant, Halton and Peel. Transportation to required off-campus courses, professional development events and schools is the responsibility of the teacher candidate. Candidates who are accepted into the BEd program to teach in secondary schools are assigned to work with specialized subject area instructors from secondary schools.'
b'The Teacher Education program reserves the right to assign Concurrent and Consecutive students to either the Hamilton or St Catharines campus. Students are responsible for their own transportation for practice teaching, courses and other activities related to the program, which may be scheduled at locations other than the assigned campus.'
b'Upon acceptance into the program, applicants must complete a satisfactory Police record check with a vulnerable sector screening. School Boards require teacher candidates to complete this background screening prior to having direct contact with students. Otherwise schools will not allow teacher candidates to participate in practice teaching. In addition, the Ontario College of Teachers requires a separate Police record check before certification.'
b'The Teacher Education program is organized subject to the requirements of Brock University and outside regulatory organizations that govern teacher education in Ontario (e.g. the Ontario College of Teachers). The program requirements for the Teacher Education program may change in order to meet the outside regulatory requirements.'
b'Teacher candidates who have successfully completed all required courses in the program for a BEd will normally be recommended to the Ontario College of Teachers for an Ontario Certificate of Qualification.'
b"An essential part of the Teacher Education program takes place in schools with at least 80 days of observation and teaching. When performance in the practicum placement is regarded as inadequate, the teacher candidate will be assessed by the Practice Teaching Co-ordinator or designate. That assessment will determine eligibility to proceed. Where performance so warrants, and in the interest of the pupils' welfare, the Teacher Education program will not place a teacher candidate in a classroom or will remove a teacher candidate from the classroom."
b'All teacher candidates are advised to refer to the policies and procedures in the Teacher Education Program Handbook.'
b'For further information regarding the Teacher Education programs, candidates should contact the Director.'
b'Those interested in a teaching career in Ontario are advised to refer to the Ontario College of Teachers Act 1996 and Regulation 176/10 Teachers Qualifications with respect to teachable subjects, definitions, basic qualifications and regulations.'

b'The goal of the Department of Music, part of the Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts, is to prepare students for their chosen musical career and to produce critically aware musicians with a broadly based musical education. The Department of Music offers programs of study leading to a Bachelor of Music (BMus) Honours, a Bachelor of Arts (BA) Honours in Music, a BA with Major in Music and a Pass BA degree program. Students may also pursue a combined major or a minor in Music.'
b'BMus and BA Honours students may earn a Concentration in Music Education or a Concentration in Music Therapy Foundations. BMus students may declare a Concentration in Music Performance following a successful audition. All concentrations are satisfied by successfully completing designated courses in addition to general program requirements. Alternatively, students may earn a BMus or a BA Honours degree without declaring a concentration.'
b'Students take core courses in music in culture, theory, general musicianship and choral ensemble. Students in the BMus program must take lessons in one of the following areas: piano, pipe organ, voice, classical guitar, harp, flute, oboe, clarinet, classical saxophone, bassoon, trumpet, French horn, trombone, tuba, percussion, violin, viola, cello and double bass. If lessons are not taken in successive years, students must re-audition.'
b'Student progress will be evaluated annually. To continue in the BMus program students must achieve a minimum grade of 60 percent in all MUSI courses and a minimum 70 percent major average. Any student who does not meet these requirements will be placed in the BA with Major program. To re-declare to BMus a student must upgrade any MUSI course in which the minimum of 60 was not achieved and raise their major average to 70 percent. Otherwise students may continue in the BA with Major program.'
b'The requirement for graduation with a BMus or BA (Honours) is a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average. The requirement for graduation with a BA with Major is a minimum 60 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent overall average.'

b'brocku.ca/neuroscience'
b'Neuroscience, the study of behaviour and its underlying neural mechanisms, is included in psychology, biology and other disciplines at many universities, but there is an increased tendency in North America and Europe to offer neuroscience as a specialized major program. Neuroscience combines selected courses from the disciplines of psychology, biology, kinesiology and computational neuroscience that illustrate cellular, physiological, behavioural and computational approaches to examining the nervous system. The program is specifically designed to permit integration of information derived experimentally from many disciplines to gain a better understanding of the relationships between neural function and behaviour. Neuroscience provides information and skills necessary for careers in the health and behavioural sciences. It also provides a firm basis for graduate studies in the neurosciences and depending on choice of courses, prepares the student for entry into medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry, chiropractic and physical or occupational therapy.'
b'The BSc Honours program is divided into five streams, allowing students to specialize in either Neurobiological, Neuropsychological, Neuromotor, Neurocomputing or Environmental Neuroscience fields. Honours students must familiarize themselves with the Neuroscience streams and plan appropriately. The Office of the Registrar must be notified of the stream you wish to pursue at the end of Year 2 with the exception of the Neurocomputing stream students who need to notify in Year 1. Except for the Neuromotor and Neurocomputing streams, the first two years are identical in the program. Honours and Co-op students must apply for entry to Year 4 in order to complete NEUR 4F90, 4F91 or 4F92. Admittance requires a minimum 70 percent average in all major credits and an average of 60 percent in the remaining credits.'
b'The BSc with Major program is designed to allow students to select courses that suit individual interests and may result in a program that is more general. However, it also offers freedom to specialize within sub-disciplines of neuroscience by following courses in any stream of the Honours program.'
b'The Neuroscience Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a five-year period. Students spend two years in an academic setting studying the core concepts of neuroscience prior to taking the first work placement. The Co-op Programs Office will facilitate admission decisions. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Neuroscience Co-op students are assessed an annual administrative fee (see the Schedule of Fees).'
b"Eligibility to continue in the Neuroscience Co-op program is based on the student's major and non-major averages. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average may continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Neuroscience Co-op program, but may continue in the non-Co-op Neuroscience streams. If a student subsequently raises his/her major average to 70 percent, the student may be readmitted only if approved by the Co-op Admissions Committee. For further information, see the Co-op Programs section of the Calendar, and contact the Centre for Neuroscience."
b"All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals(brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career."
b'Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.'
b'The Neuroscience Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.'

b'This four-year Honours program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Oenology and Viticulture is designed to meet the needs of the grape and wine industry in Canada and around the world. The aim of the program is to provide a comprehensive scientific education combined with hands-on experience in oenology and viticulture, including exposure to marketing, tourism and wine appreciation. Since "wine begins in the field and ends in the glass", our graduates will be trained in both viticulture and oenology with the option to specialize through course selection and undergraduate thesis work. The program encompasses the scientific disciplines pertaining to the grape and wine industry such as sensory science, biochemistry, biotechnology, chemistry, microbiology, genetics, cell and molecular biology, plant physiology, and environmental biology. The program enables our graduates to pursue higher education in any of these disciplines.'
b"Industry experience is an essential part of our students' preparation. To gain that experience students may elect to complete a Co-op option with their degree. Co-op students will participate in a minimum of three work terms as indicated in the program of study. At least one work term will be in a vineyard setting and a second term will be at a winery during the harvest and crush."
b'These work terms will be paid positions providing a meaningful, academically relevant employment experience within the grape and wine industry. The primary goal of the Oenology and Viticulture Co-op Program is to arrange and monitor placements within the Canadian industry. However, suitable international work terms may be used to meet the program requirements. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, students are assessed an administrative fee (see the Schedule of Fees).'
b"All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. Eligibility to continue in the Co-op option is based on the student's major and non-major averages. A student with a minimum of 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average may continue."
b'Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.'
b'Work terms will normally be done as indicated in the Program of Studies but other sequences are possible. For more information consult the Director of Co-op Programs, Admissions and Academic Adviser or the Co-operative Programs section of the calendar.'

b'The department offers four-year programs of study leading to a Bachelor of Science (BSc) Honours in Physics, a BSc Honours Co-op option in Physics, a BSc with Major Physics and a three-year BSc Pass degree program. Students may take a single major in Physics or a combined major with Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Computer Science or Mathematics.'
b'The core of the program is designed to provide an understanding of the principles and fundamental interactions of classical and quantum physics as well as many applications of these principles in technology and everyday life. It is possible for non-Physics degree students to take advanced courses, provided they have the physics and mathematics required in the year 1 Physics program. An experimental physics path of PHYS 2P30 and 3P92 or a modern physics path of PHYS 2P50 and 3P91 are possible.'
b'The Physics Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a four and one-half year period. Students spend two years in an academic setting, where they acquire the necessary background prior to taking the first work placement. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Physics Co-op students are assessed an annual administrative fee (see the Schedule of Fees).'
b"Eligibility to continue is based on the student's major average and non-major average. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average will be permitted to continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Physics Co-op program, but may continue in the Physics stream."
b"All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career."
b'Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.'
b'The Physics Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.'
b'The department also offers a Minor in Physics program. The goal of this program is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of various branches of physics and their applications. The selection of courses is tailored to the needs and interests of individual students with diverse backgrounds (philosophy, classics, business and finance, mathematics and other science programs). Students should consult one of the Undergraduate Student Advisers of the Physics Department (physics@brocku.ca or ext. 3412) to plan the sequence of courses most suited to their background and needs.'

b'Politics affects everyone. It is through politics that the future of the world we inhabit is shaped. Aristotle called politics the master science because he recognized how wide and pervasive politics is. The interests of political scientists are diverse. They include conflict at city hall or in the courtroom; the arguments and processes through which our national existence might be preserved; the collapse of Communism and the struggle to establish new political arrangements in its place; the role of pressure groups in shaping public policy; electoral reform; the control of civil servants; the rule of law among nations; the place of moral principle and national interest in the conduct of foreign policy; or how far any citizen might have the right or duty to disobey an unjust law. Political Science offers us the opportunity to become freer human beings and citizens because, whatever the subject of our immediate inquiry, the focus is always upon the ideas, institutions and processes that shape our lives.'
b'The BA Honours program provides students with the opportunity for a more intensive examination of issues in the field.'
b"Political Science may be combined at the Honours or Pass level with other disciplines, the choice depending upon the student's interests and capabilities. As well, it is possible, within the departmental offerings, to arrange a thematic program of study around a selection of courses built to suit the student's particular interests."
b'All students in Political Science especially those proceeding to graduate studies or to a career in the public service, are encouraged to become proficient in a language other than English, normally French. Students who develop interests in a particular geographical area are urged to select related courses in history, language and literature. Questions about the Political Science program should be directed to the Undergraduate Advisor.'
b'Political Science Co-operative (Co-op)'
b'The Political Science Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a four and one-half year period. Students spend two years in an academic setting doing course work prior to taking the first work term. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Political Science Co-op students are assessed an annual administration fee (see Schedule of Fees).'
b'Eligibility to continue is based on the students major average and non-major average. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average will be permitted to continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Political Science Co-op program. If a student subsequently raises their major average to 70 percent, the student may be readmitted to the Co-op program only if approved by the Co-op Education Office in consultation with the Department.'
b"All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Education Office.

b"Women's and Gender Studies is an interdisciplinary field of study distinguished by its focus on the experiences of a range of different women, - past and present - and analyses of gender. Women's and Gender Studies courses invite both male and female students to explore the interplay of gender and power, with careful attention to the intersections of race, class, sexuality, colonialism and imperialism."
b"Women's and Gender Studies students engage with women's texts and cultural artifacts, examine national and international gender politics and activism, experience innovative teaching, and develop skills in feminist theory and research methods. Students of Women's and Gender Studies are well equipped to bring a critical analysis to a range of careers including those in education, business and management, law, health, government and social services."
b"The Women's and Gender Studies program aims to provide a supportive and intellectually challenging environment to women in the university and it maintains active links to women's organizations in the community. The Centre for Women's and Gender Studies is dedicated to the memory of the fourteen women students whose deaths in 1989 at the \xc3\x89cole Polytechnique dramatized the need for a greater understanding of systemic and structural violence against women both locally and globally."
