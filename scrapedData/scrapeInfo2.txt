Technology-enabled learning – Centre for Pedagogical Innovation
Broadcast modalities of pedagogy do not necessarily resonate as strongly with learners who have been born into a networked, connected society that privileges interactivity as a learning strategy and that acknowledges new media literacies as indigenous modes of expression.
A large segment of Brock University’s growing student population can undoubtedly be identified as digital sophisticates, for whom self-expression, communication, and socializing in a wired, connected environment is unexceptional. It follows that they come to post-secondary education with the assumption that they will be able to frame their experiences, educational and otherwise, in digital contexts and through new media literacies that reflect the reality of their world.
Instructors are moving more of their instruction into online formats.

This brings together faculty from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to research how society can best move forward in a time where the earth’s natural, social, and economic resources are being threatened. The basic challenge of “sustainability” is to map out ways in which people and societies can live within the limits of our physical and natural world to safeguard our planet’s life support system. Partners from across Brock University and beyond collaboratively examine issues of: water and environmental resources; meanings and measurements of sustainability; climate change, adaptation and transformation; science and public policy; and, social justice, development and health. The Centre embraces Brock’s privileged location in a Biosphere Reserve and draws upon the UNESCO framework for understanding, innovating, and measuring all aspects of sustainability through education, science and culture.

It fosters the sharing of research by diverse elements of the community who might be working on the same issues from different perspectives.
This seeks to investigate the status and limits of the “human” in an era in which multiple crises – global warming, superintelligent computers, genetic engineering, and massive species extinction, to name but a few – mark the precariousness of exclusively human-centred practice and thought. Our transdisciplinary research unit, in collaboration with other likeminded centres, institutes, and scholars across the globe, is committed to the idea that humanity’s perseverance in the coming centuries will require collaboration with agents (animal, vegetable, fungal, viral, mineral, and digital) besides those formerly classified as “human.”

Brock University receives and hold research funds awarded to members of the University’s research community. These grants impose a duty on the University community to ensure the use of the funds meets the eligibility and compliance policies of the funder. This responsibility is shared with several stakeholders in research and research administration.
The Research Support Fund (formerly the Federal Indirect Costs Program) is a Government of Canada funding program to assist Canadian post-secondary institutions in offsetting the cost of administering research awards from the three federal granting councils (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research). Brock University receives funding support for the indirect costs incurred on Tri-Council funded research through the program.
A thriving research culture must be supported by a vast infrastructure that is often taken for granted. Laboratories require light and heat to operate, equipment needs to be maintained, library collections are built and cultivated to aid faculty and students in their research. Brock’s hundreds of researchers come to the Office of Research Services for assistance in filling out their grant applications, advice on how to comply with spending and financial requirements, navigating the system of ethical review and compliance, and in some cases communicating their research activities to a wider audience.
In 2020-2021, Brock University will allocate its Research Support Fund (RSF) funding in the following five areas:
The Office of Research Services administers, facilitates and supports international research and development at Brock University.
International activities include research in several areas.
