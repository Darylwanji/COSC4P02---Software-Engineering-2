# Description

Brock University is one of the most popular universities in Ontario and is known for a highly-rated student experience. As the number of students per year continues to increase, new software must be made to uphold the quality of the University's student experience. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, there has quickly become a need for information to be delivered as fast as possible with minimized contact. 

In addition, Brock University is hosting the Niagara 2022 Canada Summer Games, which further increases the need for a fast and efficient information delivery system.

As such, our group aims to develop chat-bots which will provide users with accurate information in the most efficient way possible regarding Brock University as well as the 2022 Niagara summer games.
