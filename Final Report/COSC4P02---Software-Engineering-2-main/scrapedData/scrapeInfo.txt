At Brock University, Applied Linguistics involves the application of linguistic theories and methods of linguistic analysis in such areas as first or subsequent language acquisition, psycholinguistics, language teaching methodology, and speech, language and hearing sciences.
Linguistics focuses on language structure, first- and subsequent-language acquisition, the role of language in communication, and languages as products of cultures and other social groups. Linguists may or may not specialize in particular languages. Typically, they analyze similarities and differences among languages; such analyses can be used to develop, support or refute linguistic theories.
Linguistics provides an opportunity to apply scientific reasoning to language-based problem solving. A background in linguistics is essential for language teachers, translators, speech-language pathologists, audiologists and many other language professionals. Additionally, linguistic knowledge can provide a valuable foundation for human interaction and communication in a wide variety of fields.
The Department of Applied Linguistics offers programs of study leading to Honours Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees in Applied Linguistics/Teaching English as a Second Language, Speech Language and Hearing Sciences. Students completing the Honours Speech Language and Hearing Sciences degree select a specialized concentration in either Hearing Sciences or Speech and Language Sciences after Year 1.
The Department also offers a four-year program of study leading to a BA with Major in Speech Language and Hearing Sciences, Pass BA degrees in Applied Linguistics, and Speech Language and Hearing Sciences and Certificates in Speech Language and Hearing Sciences, and Teaching English as a Second Language as well as a Minor in Applied Linguistics.
Skills-development courses in American Sign Language and Academic English as a Subsequent Language are also offered.

Biochemistry describes the structure, organization and function of living systems in molecular terms. The goals of biochemistry are to identify the chemical components and molecules (such as DNA, RNA and protein) of living cells and to determine the function of each component, how components interact, how they are integrated into biological systems, and how these components affect the overall functions of cells and living systems. The Biochemistry Program is a broadly based program designed to provide the student with a thorough understanding of living systems from a molecular perspective. The program is run jointly by the Departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry.
The Biochemistry Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a five-year period. Students spend two years in an academic setting studying the fundamentals of Biochemistry prior to their first work placement. Successful completion of courses in the core areas of Biochemistry provides the necessary academic background for the work experience. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Biochemistry Co-op students are assessed an administrative fee for each work term (see the Schedule of Fees).
Eligibility to continue in the Biochemistry Co-op program is based on the student's major and non-major averages. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average may continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Biochemistry Co-op program, but may continue in the non co-op Biochemistry stream. If a student subsequently raises his/her major average to 70 percent, the student may be re-admitted only if approved by the Co-op Admissions Committee. For further information, see the Co-op Programs section of the Calendar, and contact the Departments of Biological Sciences or Chemistry.
All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career.
Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.
The Biochemistry Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.

The biological sciences, or the life sciences, encompass a broad spectrum of subjects from molecular biology to ecology as well as such disciplines as biochemistry, biophysics, genetics and physiology. The program is designed to provide the student with a broad base in modern biological thought, to fulfill the basic requirements for admission to professional and advanced degree studies and to prepare graduates for careers in the biological sciences and related fields. Although the undergraduate program provides students with flexibility in selecting the areas of biology most compatible with their interests and skills, it also ensures that students develop an overview of the major concepts and problems of modern biology as expressed at all levels of biological organization.
The objectives of the undergraduate program are realized through a group of core courses in years 1 and 2, each with an associated laboratory. Laboratory classes stress the investigative approach to experimental studies. Students move progressively from structured laboratory studies to increasingly independent investigations and in the honours year undertake individual research projects. Working from the core program, students may follow a variety of curriculum patterns to satisfy their interests.
Students must consult faculty advisers when planning years 3 and 4 of the BSc (Honours) and BSc with Major programs or year 3 of the BSc (Pass) program.
The honours year provides students with the opportunity for either broadening their understanding of the biological sciences or for increased specialization. Ideally, the honours program provides an opportunity for the synthesis of material presented in earlier years. Students must apply to the Department of Biological Sciences in order to be admitted to year 4 (honours).
Prerequisite requirements are strictly enforced in Biological Sciences courses. Students lacking prerequisites will be automatically deregistered from courses. Students are encouraged to plan their courses two years ahead in order to ensure that appropriate prerequisites are obtained.
Students should be aware that numerous year 3 and 4 courses are offered in alternating years. Consult brocku.ca/mathematics-science/departments-and-centres/biology for details on yearly course offerings.

Biophysics is the physics of life, of all living systems and their interaction with the surroundings, natural and artificial. It is a relatively new, but rapidly advancing field encompassing a wide variety of areas in natural and life sciences and uses all methods of scientific inquiry: theory, experiment and large scale computer simulation to understand living systems at the molecular level. Biophysics also forms the basis of many aspects of Medical Physics, another rapidly developing field in much demand at the current time. Brock's biophysics program will provide the students with a superb learning environment and exciting research opportunities. Extended research opportunities are available through Brock's participation in the Interdepartmental Biophysics Group (BIG) based at the University of Guelph.
The interdisciplinary nature of the Biophysics program offers an opportunity to modify the sequence of courses to be taken, to reflect better the interests of the individual students. However, this places a greater onus on the students to make sure that the prerequisites are satisfied, and that a sufficient number of credits at each level is included. Biophysics students are strongly encouraged to contact the Co-ordinator no later than year 2 of their studies, to ensure that their chosen sequence of courses satisfies all academic constraints.
In view of the vastness of the field of Biophysics and the enormous diversity among its various subfields, the program offers a high degree of flexibility to its students at the 4th year level in terms of choice of BIOL, BTEC, CHEM, KINE, PHYS and PSYC/NEUR courses.
Eligibility to continue in the program is based on the student's major average. All courses required for the program, excluding the electives, will be considered for the major average.
Biophysics is an Honours only program. If a student's major average falls below the required 70 percent average by year three, they are advised to seek a three-year BSc Degree in General Studies. Students should note that such a degree requires a minimum of five credits in one subject.

Biotechnology is the use of living organisms to produce goods and services for practical and industrial purposes. Biotechnology has been used for centuries in fermentation and the making of bread and cheese, but today involves new scientific tools like genetic and protein engineering, cell fusion and production of monoclonal antibodies. Biotechnology is a strategic technology and an important economic component of industrialized nations. Biotechnology at Brock is a joint effort of the Departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, with courses drawn from both departments plus courses designed specifically for the program.
The Biotechnology Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a period of five academic years. Students spend two years in an academic setting studying the fundamentals of Biotechnology prior to their first work placement. Successful completion of courses in the core areas of Biotechnology provides the necessary academic background for the work experience. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Biotechnology Co-op students are assessed an administrative fee for each work term (see the Schedule of Fees).
Eligibility to continue in the Biotechnology Co-op program is based on the student's major and non-major averages. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average may continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Biotechnology Co-op program, but may continue in the non-co-op Biotechnology stream. If a student subsequently raises his/her major average to 70 percent, the student may be readmitted only if approved by the Co-op Admissions Committee. For further information, see the Co-op Programs section of the Calendar, and contact the Centre for Biotechnology.
All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career.
Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.
The Biotechnology Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.

brocku.ca/chemistry
Chemistry is the study of matter and its interactions with various forms of energy. Brock students are involved in the analysis, synthesis and purification of substances, determining their structures and properties and explaining the mechanisms of processes.
Our programs stress chemical principles and practice through research in organic, inorganic, analytical, physical and theoretical chemistry, with a strong emphasis on the interdisciplinary fields of bio-inorganic and bio-organic chemistry and chemical biophysics. Research interests of the department include development of new chiral ligands, organometallic reagents, and methods for asymmetric synthesis, green chemistry including bacterial dioxygenase-mediated degradation of aromatics, new approaches in natural product synthesis emphasizing morphine alkaloids, design and synthesis of fluorinated inhalation anesthetic agents and unnatural oligo-saccharide conjugates, ligand design and crystal engineering aimed at self-assembly of novel molecule-based materials, organic electrochemistry, energetics of photosynthesis studied by time-resolved electron spin resonance of short-lived paramagnetic intermediates, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, organometallic mass spectrometry, quantum and computational chemistry, pesticide and trace element analysis, protein affinity labelling and protein-lipid interactions, and structure-activity correlations of anticancer pharmaceuticals.
The Honours program in Chemistry is designed to give the student a broad knowledge of chemistry as well as depth in areas in which the student is most interested. A research project must be successfully completed and a thesis written as part of the requirements for an Honours degree. The Honours program and certain combined Honours programs listed below, when taken with CHEM electives, satisfy the requirements for membership in the Chemical Institute of Canada and are the normal requirements for admission to graduate school in chemistry.
The Chemistry Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a four and one half year period. Students spend two years in an academic setting, where they acquire the necessary background prior to taking the first work placement. Successful completion of courses in the core areas of Chemistry provides the necessary academic background for the work experience. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Chemistry Co-op students are assessed an annual administrative fee (see the Schedule of Fees).
Eligibility to continue in the Co-op program is based on the student's major average and non-major average. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average will be permitted to continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Chemistry Co-op program, but may continue in the non Co-op Chemistry stream. For further information, see the Co-op Programs section of the Calendar, and contact the Department of Chemistry.
All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career.
Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.
The requirement for graduation with a Chemistry (Honours) degree is a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average. The Chemistry Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.
The equipment available in the Mackenzie Chown and Cairns Family Health and Bioscience Research Complexes is actively used for both teaching and research. Undergraduate students gain hands-on experience in operating modern equipment for separating of complex mixtures, determining molecular structures, and making quantitative measurements. Newer equipment is computer-controlled and is connected to the University's Ethernet backbone. Student and faculty researchers have access to cluster platform systems, housed at Brock Univeristy and other SHARCNet academic institutions.
Instrumentation includes 300, 400 and 600 MHz NMR cryospectrometers for high-resolution solution and solids studies. Mass spectrometry facilities include a Thermo DFS high resolution mass spectrometer with EI, CI and FAB ion sources. It is equipped with a high performance capillary GC system. The lab also contains a Bruker HCT Ultra LC/MS system with ESI and APCI interfaces and a BrukerAutoflex II TOF/TOF MALDI system. For X-ray crystallography, a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer, equipped with an Oxford low temperature device, is available for the collection of single crystal data. A number of spectroscopic instruments are available in the research laboratories including time-resolved EPR, ICP and ICP/MS, FTIR, UV/Visible, fluorescence cuvette and microplate fluorimeters. There are several chromatography systems for HPLC, FPLC and capillary GC analysis. A state-of-the-art biotechnology research lab was recently equipped for biochemistry and microbiology work. This instrumentation is augmented by a range of modern facilities available through the Cool Climate Oenology and Viticulture Institute, which support work in biochemistry, especially work involving proteins, nucleic acids, yeasts and bacteria.
Students should consult the Department Chair when planning years 3 and 4 of the BSc (Honours) and BSc with Major programs, or year 3 of the BSc (Pass) program.
In addition to its own programs, the Chemistry department participates in combined major programs with five other departments/centres and is also a major participant in the Biochemistry, Biotechnology, and Oenology and Viticulture programs.

Classics is an interdisciplinary field, overlapping all the main areas of the Humanities. The Department of Classics offers: courses in ancient Greek (GREE) and Latin (LATI), and courses in Classics (CLAS), embracing ancient civilization in all its aspects: literature, philosophy, education, history, religion, art and archaeology. In general, CLAS courses require no knowledge of Greek or Latin.
The Department has special resources for learning about the ancient world. Archaeological training sessions are conducted in the summer in Mediterranean lands. Brock is a contributing member to several research and teaching institutions located in the Mediterranean, including the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and the Canadian Institute in Greece. The Brock Museum of Cypriote Antiquities, housed in the Department of Classics, contains a representative collection of art and artifacts from the Neolithic period to beyond the Roman Empire. The Niagara Peninsula Society of the Archaeological Institute of America, in conjunction with the Department, organizes archaeological programs and lectures.
Study tours in the Mediterranean are offered by Classics jointly with Visual Arts and other departments.
Students are encouraged to consult the Chair, Undergraduate Officer or Academic Adviser to discuss their educational objectives and career plans.
Students are advised that graduate programs in Classics require competence in Greek and Latin. Those considering graduate work in Classics should plan to take a minimum of four Greek and/or Latin (GREE/LATI) credits.

The field of Earth sciences is central in solving current problems such as waste disposal, pollution, groundwater management, volcano and earthquake hazards. It is also vital in the exploration and utilization of natural resources such as oil and gas, minerals and aggregates. A very important area of research in the Earth sciences aims to determine how the planet has evolved from its origin 4.6 billion years ago to the present. Earth's rocks and sediment provide a long record of global change in response to a variety of stimuli. Many Earth scientists are involved in the unravelling of this record of global change and in predicting future changes to the planet.
The Department of Earth Sciences offers programs dedicated to graduating high-quality geoscientists proceeding toward registration as a Professional Geoscientist (PGeo). The Department offers other options for those interested in Earth Sciences, but not intending to become Professional Geoscientists.
The Department of Earth Sciences offers four-year programs of study leading to a BSc Honours in Earth Sciences, BSc Honours in Environmental Geoscience, a BSc with Major in Earth Sciences, a BSc with Major in Environmental Geoscience and a BSc Pass degree program. In addition, five-year Co-op programs leading to a BSc Honours degree in Earth Sciences or Environmental Geoscience are available.
The four-year BSc Honours and BSc with Major programs consist of a set of core courses in year 1, year 2 and part of year 3. During year 3, students choose from elective courses to specialize in a curriculum reflecting their personal interests. Students normally enter directly into the BSc Honours program and are required to maintain at least second-class honours standing. Students not meeting this requirement may continue in one of the BSc with Major programs.
The requirement for graduation with an Earth Sciences (Honours) degree is a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average.
The requirements for a BSc with Major and a BSc (pass) are a minimum 60 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent overall average.
The Department has teaching and research laboratories which include such facilities as recirculating sediment flume, dendrochronology laboratory, glacial micromorphology laboratory, palynological laboratories, vitrinite reflectance workstation, cathodoluminescence microscopic analysis, atomic absorption spectrometry, petrographic image analysis equipment, digitizer, water quality analysis equipment, fluorometric analysis and stable isotope preparation. These are supported by rock specimen preparation and drafting facilities, a cold room, core storage facilities and Departmental collections. Departmental as well as University computing facilities are available. SEM and ICPMS facilities are also available within the Faculty of Mathematics and Science. The Department shares the facilities of electronic, machine and glass blowing shops with other departments.

Economics is divided into two parts: Microeconomics and Macroeconomics. Microeconomics focuses on the operation of the market system under alternative scenarios about competition. It studies the economic decisions of individuals, households and firms and shows how those decisions interact to produce market outcomes. Microeconomics then examines the efficiency of the market outcomes and the extent to which they benefit society. Macroeconomics examines the functioning of the broader economy and some of its key sectors. Its main focus is on economic performance as measured by employment, unemployment, and the gap between aggregate economic activity and its potential. Through this analysis, macroeconomics identifies factors that help an economy achieve sustained increases in its standard of living. Macroeconomics also pays special attention to monetary phenomena, inflation, interest rates, and the exchange rate.
The analytical tools developed in micro and macro economics are applied to many different subject areas within economics such as industrial organization, labour economics, international trade, economic development, taxation, and government expenditure. Other fields, such as money and banking and international payments, apply economic tools to the study of financial markets. The analyses yield insights and predictions that are used to develop public policy on a wide range of issues.
The Economics (Honours) program provides a rigorous examination of economics. It prepares students for positions in all sectors of the economy and it is the recommended program for students considering graduate studies in economics. The Bachelor of Arts (BA) with Major Economics program also provides an in-depth study of economics, but it allows for more choice and breadth since it does not require some of the more technical senior level Economics courses. The pass Economics program covers the core topics in economics and allows students to complete a BA after completing only 15 credits.

The Continuing Teacher Education program offers a Bachelor of Education Specialist Program as a professional post certification degree that builds on the Three-Session Additional Qualification courses accredited by the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT). This program does not lead to teacher certification in Ontario. Those interested in obtaining an Ontario Certificate of Qualification (OCQ) should consult the Department of Teacher Education.
The Bachelor of Education Specialist Program is a professional degree option for teachers who already hold a Bachelor of Education Degree from an accredited university and are registered with the OCT as eligible to undertake Additional Qualification courses. The Bachelor of Education Specialist degree provides certified teachers with a second professional degree for the purposes of skills and career enhancement. For teachers certified in jurisdictions other than Ontario the Bachelor of Education Specialist Program provides an opportunity to obtain training in specific education areas that may not be available in their home jurisdictions and which will be recorded on university transcripts. The Bachelor of Education Specialist Program is based on Additional Qualification courses that go beyond initial Bachelor of Education degree preparation and provide opportunities and resources for in-depth research and study in the areas of teaching, learning and curriculum.

Housed within the Department of Educational Studies, the Teacher Education program offers three programs of study at the St. Catharines and Hamilton campuses for candidates interested in teaching Primary/Junior (grades K-6), Junior/Intermediate (grades 4-10) and Intermediate/Senior (grades 7-12). Field placements for the Junior/Intermediate program will normally be made in grades 4-8. Field placements for the Intermediate/Senior program will normally be made in grades 9-12.
In addition, the Teacher Education program co-operates with other departments in offering concurrent programs leading to the conferring of a BA (Honours)/BEd (Intermediate/Senior), BA Child and Youth Studies (Honours)/BEd (Primary/Junior), BA Integrated Studies (Honours)/BEd (Junior/Intermediate), BPhEd (Honours)/BEd (Intermediate/Senior), BPhEd (Honours)/BEd (Junior/Intermediate), BSc (Honours)/BEd (Intermediate/Senior), BA Interactive Arts and Science (Honours)/BEd (Junior/Intermediate) and BSc Integrated Studies (Honours)/BEd (Junior/Intermediate).
Teacher Education programs are field oriented and are based on an approach unique in Ontario. Much of the orientation to and instruction in professional practice takes place through supervised cohorts of teacher candidates in schools throughout the Niagara Peninsula and the regions of Hamilton Wentworth, Haldimand-Brant, Halton and Peel. Transportation to required off-campus courses, professional development events and schools is the responsibility of the teacher candidate. Candidates who are accepted into the BEd program to teach in secondary schools are assigned to work with specialized subject area instructors from secondary schools.
The Teacher Education program reserves the right to assign Concurrent and Consecutive students to either the Hamilton or St Catharines campus. Students are responsible for their own transportation for practice teaching, courses and other activities related to the program, which may be scheduled at locations other than the assigned campus.
Upon acceptance into the program, applicants must complete a satisfactory Police record check with a vulnerable sector screening. School Boards require teacher candidates to complete this background screening prior to having direct contact with students. Otherwise schools will not allow teacher candidates to participate in practice teaching. In addition, the Ontario College of Teachers requires a separate Police record check before certification.
The Teacher Education program is organized subject to the requirements of Brock University and outside regulatory organizations that govern teacher education in Ontario (e.g. the Ontario College of Teachers). The program requirements for the Teacher Education program may change in order to meet the outside regulatory requirements.
Teacher candidates who have successfully completed all required courses in the program for a BEd will normally be recommended to the Ontario College of Teachers for an Ontario Certificate of Qualification.
An essential part of the Teacher Education program takes place in schools with at least 80 days of observation and teaching. When performance in the practicum placement is regarded as inadequate, the teacher candidate will be assessed by the Practice Teaching Co-ordinator or designate. That assessment will determine eligibility to proceed. Where performance so warrants, and in the interest of the pupils' welfare, the Teacher Education program will not place a teacher candidate in a classroom or will remove a teacher candidate from the classroom.
All teacher candidates are advised to refer to the policies and procedures in the Teacher Education Program Handbook.
For further information regarding the Teacher Education programs, candidates should contact the Director.
Those interested in a teaching career in Ontario are advised to refer to the Ontario College of Teachers Act 1996 and Regulation 176/10 Teachers Qualifications with respect to teachable subjects, definitions, basic qualifications and regulations.

brocku.ca/game
Computer and video games can be complex expressive, narrative, experiential, intelligent, cultural and creative systems. They integrate many types of content and media and are presented on a wide range of interactive digital platforms. The creation of computer games requires highly diverse technical and creative conceptualization, design, implementation and production processes. Games are typically produced by teams of people with specialized knowledge and skills who also understand and support the larger enterprise of the game which is to provide a user/player with challenge, agency and experience.
The GAME program combines study at Brock University and Niagara College, focusng on the concepts, contexts and mechanics of computer games. Students may choose one of two study options: Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Game Design and an Advanced Diploma in Game Development or a Bachelor of Science (Honours) Game Programming and an Advanced Diploma in Game Development. Students examine the history, discourses and production of games and participate in three major collaborative projects that result in the creation and production of fully realized computer games in the second, third and fourth years of the program.
Eligibility to continue in the GAME program is based on a student's major average and non-major average. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average will be permitted to continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the GAME program. With the approval of the Director of the Centre for Digital Humanities or the Chair of the Department of Computer Science, a student who is not eligible to continue may be permitted to complete a Bachelor of Arts degree in Interactive Arts and Science or a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science respectively. Required courses not yet completed in these programs will need to be met.

The discipline of Geography has a broad scope and combines elements of both the social and natural sciences. Two principal divisions of the subject exist - human geography and physical geography - linked by a common background: a mutual concern for humans and the environment, and a body of related theory and methodology.
Geography majors at Brock may choose from the following degree programs: BA Geography and BSc Geography. Within each program students with a minimum 70 percent major average may be admitted to the Honours degree program at any time. An Honours degree program provides students with an opportunity for a more intensive examination of issues in the discipline. These programs are described in detail in subsequent sections.
The Department also participates in four-year Co-op programs leading to a BA or BSc Honours degree.
The Department and the Faculty of Education co-operate in offering a Concurrent BA (Honours) or BSc (Honours)/BEd degree at both the Junior/Intermediate and Intermediate/Senior levels.
Most courses emphasize structured labs and seminars in early years and progressively more independent work in later years, culminating in an optional honours thesis in year 4. Field work features prominently in some courses. Students should note that a nominal fee may be charged in courses having a field work or laboratory component.
Two field courses, GEOG 3P56 and 3P57, are held in October in the week following Thanksgiving Day, with seminars/labs during the term. One of these courses is mandatory for students entering year 3; prospective students must register with the Department by April of the preceding academic year.
GEOG 4F99 is a required internship course in year 4, enabling students to obtain work experience while still at the University. Prospective students must register with the Department by April of the preceding academic year.
Physical laboratories and equipment are available for work in biogeography, climatology, geomorphology, hydrology and soil science. Computer labs with geomatics software are also available for students interested in geographic information systems, remote sensing and digital mapping. The University Map, Data and GIS Library contains an extensive collection of maps, atlases and geospatial datasets housed adjacent to the Department of Geography and Tourism Studies.

brocku.ca/history
Historians explore changes in past societies, cultures and peoples. They examine cultural, artistic, political, economic, intellectual, social, military and national history. Their interests range from the history of individuals and local communities to studies of nations and international relations. They analyse the causes and consequences of significant change over time. They seek to illuminate the past.
The study of history involves surveying and gathering evidence and evaluating, interpreting and refining it by constructing clear and logical arguments on the basis of that evidence.
Within the requirements indicated under the Honours program and Pass program, the Department allows students considerable flexibility in the selection of HIST courses.
To assist students in refining their analytical and critical skills, weekly seminars are a crucial part of every history course. In many courses, individual students are given the responsibility of organizing and leading discussions on particular topics.
The Department of History recommends combining History with other disciplines, such as Child and Youth Studies, Classics, Economics, English Language and Literature, Geography, Labour Studies, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, Women's and Gender Studies.
To qualify for admission to year 4 (honours), students must have a minimum 70 major average and approval of the Department. The application deadline is March 1 of the preceding academic year. Students wishing to apply for admission must meet with the Humanities Academic Adviser prior to the application deadline. See the Department for additional information.

The Interactive Arts and Science (IASC) program focuses on the intersection of digital technologies and the humanities. The program prepares the next generation of digital media innovators and scholars.
The IASC program is offered through the Centre for Digital Humanities (CDH), which is centrally located on Brock's main campus. The CDH features a wide range of media production facilities that IASC students can utilize in order to achieve their scholarly and creative goals.
The IASC program features academic and hands-on experiences that blend theory and practice. Students explore digital and interactive tools for analyzing, representing and visualizing ideas across disciplinary subjects.
IASC students can choose from a wide selection of courses that focus on interactive media, its theoretical foundations and underlying production methods. Several courses are cross-listed with other academic programs at Brock. There are also directed project courses and an internship option that allow students to gain credit for learning experiences outside the formal classroom.
The IASC program is highly individualized. IASC students can pursue an Honours or Pass Major, a Combined Major or a Minor program of study. Students can also focus their IASC studies on one of four concentration areas.
Most courses are taught in small groups. The IASC program is designed to maximize choice and flexibility so that students can personalize their programs of study. There are also opportunities to collaborate with others, including faculty members and industry experts, on scholarly and interactive media projects.

It also offers a 20 credit Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) and six-year Concurrent Bachelor of Physical Education (Honours)/Bachelor of Education (BPhEd (Honours)/BEd) Intermediate/Senior and BPhEd (Honours)/BEd Junior/Intermediate degrees.
Requirement for graduation with a BKin (Honours), BSc (Kin) (Honours) or BPhEd (Honours) degree is a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average. Requirement for graduation with a BKin, BSc (Kin) with Major or BPhEd with Major degree is a minimum 60 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent overall average.
Students who are entering into Years 2 and 3 are eligible to submit new applications to the BKin, BSc(Kin) or BPhEd programs. Application forms must be completed and returned to the office by May 15. These are limited enrolment programs. Admission is not guaranteed by attainment of the minimum requirements.
The BKin degree focuses on the biophysical, behavioural and socio-cultural aspects of kinesiology and is based on a science-practice model that prepares students for selected certification in the allied health professions emphasizing bioscience courses, the development of research skills and the application of theoretical knowledge in laboratory settings.
The BSc (Kin) degree focuses on the biophysical aspects of kinesiology and prepares students for careers in various health professions. This bioscience degree is designed for the student who wishes to concentrate on the science of human movement and prepares students to meet the requirements for postgraduate degree programs in biophysical kinesiology and the allied health professions.
The Accelerate into Masters (AIM) program allows a limited number of students (10 per year) direct entry into both a four year BKin and a one year Masters of Professional Kinesiology (MPK) allowing for the completion of two degrees within five years. Students may also choose to decline the MPK program following the completion of their BKin degree to accommodate for changes to their career and/or academic aspirations.
Students in this program must continue to meet current BKin criteria to remain in the program (see program notes). Continued admissibility into the MPK requires a minimum overall average of 78 per cent in the final two years of the BKin degree (see https://brocku.ca/applied-health-sciences/master-of-professional-kinesiology/).
The BPhEd degree provides students with a broadly based understanding of the discipline through theoretical and practical courses in physical education. This program allows maximum opportunity for students to pursue various combinations of courses in teaching, coaching, programming and administration within their particular areas of interest (see Physical Education Subfields).
Successful graduates of the Concurrent BPhEd (Honours)/BEd degree will receive an Honours Bachelor of Physical Education degree and a Bachelor of Education degree. The Dean of the Faculty of Education may recommend that the Ontario College of Teachers grant Ontario Certificate of Qualification certifying them to teach either Junior/Intermediate (grades 4-10) or Intermediate/Senior (grades 7-12).

Our work determines how we spend many of our waking hours and it largely defines our position in society, our economic well-being and our self-image. It also defines the nature of our society and economy, since these are determined by the work efforts of individuals. Restructuring of the labour force, technological change, de-skilling, re-skilling, changing labour legislation, labour market segmentation, women's work and equality in the workplace are some of the issues that stimulate teaching and research in the Department of Labour Studies.
Given the complex and multifaceted nature of work, Labour Studies adopts a multi disciplinary approach to its study. Labour Studies offers four-year programs of study leading to a BA (Honours) Labour Studies, a BA with Major Labour Studies and a three-year Pass degree program. In addition students can combine Labour Studies with several other disciplines in a combined major program leading to a four-year BA (Honours) degree and a three-year BA Pass degree. The program provides a social science perspective on the study of work with the participation of the departments of Economics, Geography, History, Political Science and Sociology.
Students may earn a Concentration in Labour Studies by including Labour Studies and other approved courses, as part of their academic work leading to an Honours BA in Economics, Political Science or Sociology.

The Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies offers an excellent opportunity to study medieval and Renaissance culture and society from an interdisciplinary and cross-cultural study of the history, literature, philosophy, art and architecture of cultures across the globe from 400 CE to 1700 CE. To this end, we have participating faculty from Digital Humanities, English Language and Literature, History, Modern Languages, Literature and Cultures, Music, Visual Arts, Philosophy, and Classics.
The Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies offers a combined major program leading to a BA (Honours) and Minor for students in other disciplines. Medieval and Renaissance Studies can be combined with any other program offering a combined major option. Medieval and Renaissance Studies core courses may also be taken as electives by students in other disciplines.
Course offerings range from the late Roman world to Renaissance Italy, from Byzantium to Iceland, and from the reading of seminal authors like Dante, Chaucer and Shakespeare among many others. As well, our courses explore the culture, religion, music, architecture and art of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.
The Middle Ages and Renaissance were instrumental in shaping the cultures in which we live. The interdisciplinary understanding of how Medieval and Renaissance cultures worked will illustrate their legacy to us, and their importance in shaping who and what we are. Our program seeks to help the students develop the skills of critical inquiry, analysis, argument and expression needed for the treatment of these questions.
The Centre recommends that students have their programs reviewed each year by the Faculty of Humanities Undergraduate Adviser and/or the Director. Students planning to enter fourth year are required to have their programs approved by the Humanities Undergraduate Adviser as well as the Director.
Students considering graduate work in Medieval and/or Renaissance Studies should note that graduate programs normally require competence in Latin and other languages depending on the specific area of study.
Study Abroad
In the Spring session, the Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies often offers study abroad courses such as MARS 3F50 Reading the Italian Medieval and Renaissance City. For information contact the Director.

The goal of the Department of Music, part of the Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts, is to prepare students for their chosen musical career and to produce critically aware musicians with a broadly based musical education. The Department of Music offers programs of study leading to a Bachelor of Music (BMus) Honours, a Bachelor of Arts (BA) Honours in Music, a BA with Major in Music and a Pass BA degree program. Students may also pursue a combined major or a minor in Music.
BMus and BA Honours students may earn a Concentration in Music Education or a Concentration in Music Therapy Foundations. BMus students may declare a Concentration in Music Performance following a successful audition. All concentrations are satisfied by successfully completing designated courses in addition to general program requirements. Alternatively, students may earn a BMus or a BA Honours degree without declaring a concentration.
Students take core courses in music in culture, theory, general musicianship and choral ensemble. Students in the BMus program must take lessons in one of the following areas: piano, pipe organ, voice, classical guitar, harp, flute, oboe, clarinet, classical saxophone, bassoon, trumpet, French horn, trombone, tuba, percussion, violin, viola, cello and double bass. If lessons are not taken in successive years, students must re-audition.
Student progress will be evaluated annually. To continue in the BMus program students must achieve a minimum grade of 60 percent in all MUSI courses and a minimum 70 percent major average. Any student who does not meet these requirements will be placed in the BA with Major program. To re-declare to BMus a student must upgrade any MUSI course in which the minimum of 60 was not achieved and raise their major average to 70 percent. Otherwise students may continue in the BA with Major program.

Neuroscience, the study of behaviour and its underlying neural mechanisms, is included in psychology, biology and other disciplines at many universities, but there is an increased tendency in North America and Europe to offer neuroscience as a specialized major program. Neuroscience combines selected courses from the disciplines of psychology, biology, kinesiology and computational neuroscience that illustrate cellular, physiological, behavioural and computational approaches to examining the nervous system. The program is specifically designed to permit integration of information derived experimentally from many disciplines to gain a better understanding of the relationships between neural function and behaviour. Neuroscience provides information and skills necessary for careers in the health and behavioural sciences. It also provides a firm basis for graduate studies in the neurosciences and depending on choice of courses, prepares the student for entry into medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry, chiropractic and physical or occupational therapy.
The BSc Honours program is divided into five streams, allowing students to specialize in either Neurobiological, Neuropsychological, Neuromotor, Neurocomputing or Environmental Neuroscience fields. Honours students must familiarize themselves with the Neuroscience streams and plan appropriately. The Office of the Registrar must be notified of the stream you wish to pursue at the end of Year 2 with the exception of the Neurocomputing stream students who need to notify in Year 1. Except for the Neuromotor and Neurocomputing streams, the first two years are identical in the program. Honours and Co-op students must apply for entry to Year 4 in order to complete NEUR 4F90, 4F91 or 4F92. Admittance requires a minimum 70 percent average in all major credits and an average of 60 percent in the remaining credits.
The BSc with Major program is designed to allow students to select courses that suit individual interests and may result in a program that is more general. However, it also offers freedom to specialize within sub-disciplines of neuroscience by following courses in any stream of the Honours program.
The Neuroscience Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a five-year period. Students spend two years in an academic setting studying the core concepts of neuroscience prior to taking the first work placement. The Co-op Programs Office will facilitate admission decisions. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Neuroscience Co-op students are assessed an annual administrative fee (see the Schedule of Fees).
Eligibility to continue in the Neuroscience Co-op program is based on the student's major and non-major averages. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average may continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Neuroscience Co-op program, but may continue in the non-Co-op Neuroscience streams. If a student subsequently raises his/her major average to 70 percent, the student may be readmitted only if approved by the Co-op Admissions Committee. For further information, see the Co-op Programs section of the Calendar, and contact the Centre for Neuroscience.
All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals(brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career.
Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.
The Neuroscience Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.

This four-year Honours program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Oenology and Viticulture is designed to meet the needs of the grape and wine industry in Canada and around the world. The aim of the program is to provide a comprehensive scientific education combined with hands-on experience in oenology and viticulture, including exposure to marketing, tourism and wine appreciation. Since "wine begins in the field and ends in the glass", our graduates will be trained in both viticulture and oenology with the option to specialize through course selection and undergraduate thesis work. The program encompasses the scientific disciplines pertaining to the grape and wine industry such as sensory science, biochemistry, biotechnology, chemistry, microbiology, genetics, cell and molecular biology, plant physiology, and environmental biology. The program enables our graduates to pursue higher education in any of these disciplines.
Industry experience is an essential part of our students' preparation. To gain that experience students may elect to complete a Co-op option with their degree. Co-op students will participate in a minimum of three work terms as indicated in the program of study. At least one work term will be in a vineyard setting and a second term will be at a winery during the harvest and crush.
These work terms will be paid positions providing a meaningful, academically relevant employment experience within the grape and wine industry. The primary goal of the Oenology and Viticulture Co-op Program is to arrange and monitor placements within the Canadian industry. However, suitable international work terms may be used to meet the program requirements. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, students are assessed an administrative fee (see the Schedule of Fees).
All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. Eligibility to continue in the Co-op option is based on the student's major and non-major averages. A student with a minimum of 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average may continue.
Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.
Work terms will normally be done as indicated in the Program of Studies but other sequences are possible. For more information consult the Director of Co-op Programs, Admissions and Academic Adviser or the Co-operative Programs section of the calendar.
The program of Oenology and Viticulture is associated for the purposes of research with the Cool Climate Oenology and Viticulture Institute (CCOVI).

The department offers four-year programs of study leading to a Bachelor of Science (BSc) Honours in Physics, a BSc Honours Co-op option in Physics, a BSc with Major Physics and a three-year BSc Pass degree program. Students may take a single major in Physics or a combined major with Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Computer Science or Mathematics.
The core of the program is designed to provide an understanding of the principles and fundamental interactions of classical and quantum physics as well as many applications of these principles in technology and everyday life. It is possible for non-Physics degree students to take advanced courses, provided they have the physics and mathematics required in the year 1 Physics program. An experimental physics path of PHYS 2P30 and 3P92 or a modern physics path of PHYS 2P50 and 3P91 are possible.
The Physics Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a four and one-half year period. Students spend two years in an academic setting, where they acquire the necessary background prior to taking the first work placement. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Physics Co-op students are assessed an annual administrative fee (see the Schedule of Fees).
Eligibility to continue is based on the student's major average and non-major average. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average will be permitted to continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Physics Co-op program, but may continue in the Physics stream.
All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career.
Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.
The Physics Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.
The department also offers a Minor in Physics program. The goal of this program is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of various branches of physics and their applications. The selection of courses is tailored to the needs and interests of individual students with diverse backgrounds (philosophy, classics, business and finance, mathematics and other science programs). Students should consult one of the Undergraduate Student Advisers of the Physics Department (physics@brocku.ca or ext. 3412) to plan the sequence of courses most suited to their background and needs.

Politics affects everyone. It is through politics that the future of the world we inhabit is shaped. Aristotle called politics the master science because he recognized how wide and pervasive politics is. The interests of political scientists are diverse. They include conflict at city hall or in the courtroom; the arguments and processes through which our national existence might be preserved; the collapse of Communism and the struggle to establish new political arrangements in its place; the role of pressure groups in shaping public policy; electoral reform; the control of civil servants; the rule of law among nations; the place of moral principle and national interest in the conduct of foreign policy; or how far any citizen might have the right or duty to disobey an unjust law. Political Science offers us the opportunity to become freer human beings and citizens because, whatever the subject of our immediate inquiry, the focus is always upon the ideas, institutions and processes that shape our lives.
The BA Honours program provides students with the opportunity for a more intensive examination of issues in the field.
Political Science may be combined at the Honours or Pass level with other disciplines, the choice depending upon the student's interests and capabilities. As well, it is possible, within the departmental offerings, to arrange a thematic program of study around a selection of courses built to suit the student's particular interests.
All students in Political Science especially those proceeding to graduate studies or to a career in the public service, are encouraged to become proficient in a language other than English, normally French. Students who develop interests in a particular geographical area are urged to select related courses in history, language and literature. Questions about the Political Science program should be directed to the Undergraduate Advisor.
Political Science Co-operative (Co-op)
The Political Science Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a four and one-half year period. Students spend two years in an academic setting doing course work prior to taking the first work term. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Political Science Co-op students are assessed an annual administration fee (see Schedule of Fees).
Eligibility to continue is based on the students major average and non-major average. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average will be permitted to continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Political Science Co-op program. If a student subsequently raises their major average to 70 percent, the student may be readmitted to the Co-op program only if approved by the Co-op Education Office in consultation with the Department.
All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Education Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career.
Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Education Office.
The Political Science Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.

The Department of Psychology offers four-year programs of study leading to a BA (Honours) Psychology, a BA with Major Psychology, and a three-year BA Pass degree program. Programs are designed to provide students with a broad introduction to the field of psychology including research methodology, psychological theory and application. In addition, the 20-credit degree programs give students the opportunity to prepare for admission to professional and advanced degree training in a variety of fields. Students interested in pursuing graduate study specifically in psychology should complete the Honours program.
Students wishing to major in Psychology must apply to declare their major. Declare or Change Major forms are available in the Registrar's Office and online at brocku.ca/registrar/forms. The Department believes that a broadly-based liberal arts and science background is appropriate in conjunction with a major in Psychology. It is required that Honours students acquire some background in other disciplines as part of their undergraduate program by taking elective courses in areas outside of Psychology. Students wishing to pursue an Honours (Research) degree must complete a PSYC 4F91 Application. Applications are available in the Department of Psychology.
Students wishing to take PSYC 3F40 and 3P39 require a minimum 77 percent major average. Students wishing to take PSYC 4F91, 4P93 and 4P95 require a minimum 80 percent major average.
The requirements for graduation with a BA (Honours) are a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average. The requirements for a BA with Major and a Pass BA are a minimum 60 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent overall average.

The Department of Recreation and Leisure Studies offers four-year programs of study leading to a Bachelor of Recreation and Leisure Studies Honours and a Bachelor of Recreation and Leisure Studies with Major. The Department also offers a three-year (Pass) program leading to a Bachelor of Recreation and Leisure Studies. The program is designed to qualify graduates for a wide range of positions in the field of leisure services.
The Community Recreation program prepares students with the knowledge, competencies, and philosophical grounding to take leadership roles in the community sector. Courses prepare students for effective practice in public and non-profit settings with courses in organizational development, finance, marketing, programming, planning, and research. Community development and responsiveness to diversity are emphasized, particularly of youth and groups that are marginalized. Fieldwork opportunities and community engagement are embedded throughout the curriculum.
The Outdoor Recreation program focuses on leadership in the natural environment. This program provides students with the skills, knowledge and dispositions necessary to serve as wilderness trip leaders, to facilitate groups in outdoor recreation settings, to work in a variety of outdoor and experiential education environments, and to serve as agents of social and environmental change in the world. All classroom and field-based activities include lectures, outdoor and experiential activities, and small group work.

The Centre for Studies in Arts and Culture, part of the Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts, is designed for students who wish to gain a critical view as well as experiential knowledge of contemporary culture from the perspectives of observer, creator, performer or cultural agent.
Our aim is to contribute to the vitality of the arts by developing informed audiences, practitioners or critics who are engaged by interdisciplinary practices and discourses in creative work, whether dance, video, music, theatre or the visual arts. The Centre for Studies in Arts and Culture is dedicated to developing a context in which the contemporary artist, performer, critic, curator or cultural agent can examine pragmatic and theoretical approaches to understanding the creative process and its cultural implications.
In consultation with the Director, students are encouraged to organize their program of study around one of the following emphases: arts and cultural management, intermedia and interdisciplinarity, and cultural critique and agency.
As part of their Studies in Arts and Culture Honours degree program, students may complete a Concentration in Cultural Management offered in co-operation with the Faculty of Business, a Concentration in Languages, Arts and Cultures in co-operation with the Department of Modern Languages, Literatures and Cultures or a Concentration in Cultural Transmission and Heritage Studies in co-operation with the Department of History and the Department of Geography and Tourism Studies.

Marilyn I. Walker 328
brocku.ca/visualarts
The Department of Visual Arts, part of the Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts, is concerned with the nature, function and history of visual arts, from the classics to popular culture, from ancient drawings and rituals to the avant-garde. Through critical analysis of classic works and personal creative development, the student will gain an awareness of the ways in which artistic media function. Our aim is to contribute to the vitality of the arts by developing sensitive, creative and articulate artists, teachers, audiences and graduates who are disciplined and adaptable, with both research skills and experience in studio practice.
The Visual Arts program consists of courses in studio and in the history of art and visual culture. In both cases, our courses provide a practical and critical understanding of the visual arts emphasizing personal development. To this end students are introduced to a range of historical, theoretical and critical approaches to art-making and to the investigation of cultural documents. Students are encouraged to extend their experience through exposure to events sponsored by the Department of Visual Arts and the Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts. Students are also offered opportunities to visit galleries and exhibitions through field trips organized by the Department of Visual Arts or in the context of specific course curriculum.
Students may take their degree in either History of Art and Visual Culture or Studio Art.
Studio activities that include intuitive, analytical and conceptual approaches are designed with the aspirations of the student artist in mind. Options are encouraged in the studio with introductory or advanced courses in drawing, painting and interdisciplinary workshops; additional courses in sculpture, photography and digital media broaden the experience and introduce the photographic, video or electronic medium to students. Student learning is facilitated by artist-teachers who have professional experience and standing in the disciplines they teach.
History of Art and Visual Culture courses examine the development of artistic styles as well as the critical and aesthetic issues that these styles bring into play. Major artists and movements are related to their cultural contexts and artistic traditions with the goal of developing critical as well as aesthetic acumen. With the choice of a Major or Minor in the History of Art and Visual Culture, students can explore the cultural, theoretical or practical methods involving the interpretation or exhibition of works of art.
The BSc (Honours) in Computer Science and Visual Arts program is tailored to students who may be interested in career paths in software development and digital media. The degree gives a solid foundation in computer technology and software science, as well as essential foundations in visual arts, emphasizing digital media.
Enrolment in most studio courses is limited to between 15 and 18 students, depending upon the course. VISA 4F06 is restricted to 8 students due to space limitations.

Women's and Gender Studies is an interdisciplinary field of study distinguished by its focus on the experiences of a range of different women, - past and present - and analyses of gender. Women's and Gender Studies courses invite both male and female students to explore the interplay of gender and power, with careful attention to the intersections of race, class, sexuality, colonialism and imperialism.
Women's and Gender Studies students engage with women's texts and cultural artifacts, examine national and international gender politics and activism, experience innovative teaching, and develop skills in feminist theory and research methods. Students of Women's and Gender Studies are well equipped to bring a critical analysis to a range of careers including those in education, business and management, law, health, government and social services.
The Women's and Gender Studies program aims to provide a supportive and intellectually challenging environment to women in the university and it maintains active links to women's organizations in the community. The Centre for Women's and Gender Studies is dedicated to the memory of the fourteen women students whose deaths in 1989 at the cole Polytechnique dramatized the need for a greater understanding of systemic and structural violence against women both locally and globally.
